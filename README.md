## üõ†Ô∏è Prompts

The prompts used for generating the blog content and images are defined at the top of the script for easy modification:

```
PROMPT_BLOG_TITLE = (
    "Keyword: {keyword} | USING A MAXIMUM OF 40 CHARACTERS IN YOUR RESPONSE: Generate a h1 / new blog title for our website. "
    "The purpose of our blog is to provide valuable insights, tips, and tricks relevant to our audience. "
    "Keep SEO in mind. Make sure it is not a duplicate of the following posts as they already exist: {post_titles}. Use them as inspiration for the type of posts we create. "
    "Also, try to make an even balance of topics across these categories: {categories}. If you decide to include a year, the current year is 2024, but do not use 'Local SEO in 2024:' for example. "
    "NEVER use ':' in your title response. Only return the title and nothing else. No other text. Just the title text. Do not enclose it in double quotes either. "
    "This is very important that you only return the title text and create an SEO optimized header using the keyword in the header. 50-60 total characters max."
)

PROMPT_BLOG_OUTLINE = (
    "Generate a blog outline for the following blog title / h1: {blog_title}. It's vital that the response is only the JSON that matches this structure as an example: {example} "
    "but include more than just the 2 sections, they're just examples of the JSON format needed per each object. End with a conclusion for each main section. The conclusion doesn't have subsections. "
    "It is VITAL that you provide valid JSON only in the response. For example, No other words or chars, and ' not \"s."
)

PROMPT_SECTION_INTRO = (
    "You are an expert SEO content writer targeting the keyword '{keyword}'. Generate an introduction for the section titled '{section_title}' with the following subsections in mind: {subsections}. "
    "Don't include numbers in the subsections if you mention them. Don't mention them all either. Just write about the section in general. It's okay to mention the subsections in the intro, but don't mention them all."
)

PROMPT_SUBSECTION = (
    "You are an expert SEO content writer and blogger targeting the keyword {keyword}. Given the blog title '{blog_title}', section title '{section_title}', and subsection title '{subsection_title}', generate the content for the current subsection. "
    "Do not include numbered points in here unless it makes sense for a specific part of what you're writing. Note: please put each paragraph in <p> tags. "
    "Also, if it makes sense, include a hyperlink to an applicable link from the following from our website: {urls}. For example <a href=\"url\"> some text</a>. "
    "You should only include a hyperlink 10 percent of the time you see this message. Additionally, include an applicable & relevant HTML table relevant to the subsection title. Use proper HTML table tags."
)

PROMPT_IMAGE = (
    "Return a prompt for Dall-e image generation that can be used as a cover/hero image for a blog background hero image / title image. The blog title is the following for context: {query}. "
    "Example prompt for a post about SEO: 'Business meeting, office, photorealism, looking at chart on screen'."
)
```
